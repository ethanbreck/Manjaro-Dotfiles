Abstract
YouTube is a company representative of its original context, Web 2.0, that originally positioned itself as an open and collaborative platform to broadcast videos created by all kinds of users; their slogan was, and remains, Broadcast yourself. The acquisition of YouTube by Google introduced it in the search for profit in the framework of OTT (over the top) communication. The YouTube homepage reveals the successive business policies followed by the platform. In this work we analyze the evolution of the unlogged homepage of YouTube Spain between 2009 and 2018. We observe the gradual disappearance of the videos produced by private users and its replacement by those made by professional users (youtubers) and cultural industries. There is a remarkable parallelism between the implementation of business models and the greater or lesser recommendation of video from one kind of user or another.

1. Approach

YouTube was created in 2005, initially as a website dedicated to sharing, free of charge, videos deposited there by users. In the context of technological and sociocultural changes, that of Web 2.0, interpretations of an optimistic nature were encouraged, stimulated by the recurrent association of certain emerging technologies with imaginary elements related to progress and innovation (Silver, 2008). YouTube appeared as the most genuine expression of that new sociocultural tendency towards self-expression and participation.

The disruptive nature of this new platform and its brilliant success soon made it the largest repository of popular culture, which caused a wave of studies largely enthusiastic about the circulation of videos produced by users (Arthurs; Drokopoulou; Gandini, 2018).

In 2006, Google bought YouTube for a multimillion-dollar amount, seeking to convert it into the reference platform in online video and make that investment profitable. Consequently, YouTube began to maintain a unique

Although YouTube’s social success is unquestionable, its profitability remains a challenge

place in the competitive –and increasingly concentrated-

online OTT (over the top) scenario. Following a philosophy based on the success of Google, YouTube developed some

lines of action and business models aimed at obtaining the expected return.

The extraordinary amount of data generated by YouTube includes unique users, the frequency of its use, and the number of videos uploaded, all of which confirm that YouTube is a global success. YouTube has become the main online video platform. In parallel with the development of this platform, the research on YouTube has multiplied and matured, orienting both its observation as a unique scenario where social life manifests itself as well as the appropriate methods for its study (Arthurs; Drokopoulou; Gandini, 2018). But it also includes the observation of the mechanisms on which its economic orientation rests.

As early as 2009 Gehl pointed out that YouTube was a repository, based on the –free of charge- work of users, who would not only assume the cost of producing videos and the traditional risk of success or failure, but also the tasks of depositing in that repository their productions, classifying them, and describing them (tags, titles, descriptions) (Gehl, 2009). It made it easier for other users to access these videos and maintain certain interactions with them, which would provide YouTube with other forms of benefit based on the users’ actions (in their number of views, likes, and comments).

YouTube stores an exorbitant number of videos that, potentially, have the same diffusion capacity among millions of global audiences. That is why the technology on which YouTube rests is of special importance, because it has the ability to obtain and process data about user behaviors –with the aim, among others, of guiding the production of content (Poell et al., 2017) for a better construction of audiences and to facilitate their profiles to advertisers- as well as in the establishment of a mechanized system of recommendations.

Algorithms are at the heart of the technology behind the successful functioning of YouTube. This platform proposes, on its homepage, content recommendations that are linked to previous behaviors, for which registration (logging in) is necessary. If the user does not login, the section “Trends” gives some options for viewing videos linked, among other issues, to the social consumption dynamics of the platform treated algorithmically. Within this algorithm the number of reproductions of the content plays an important role, adding the interaction, the currency of the video, the number of subscriptions and the oscillation between the change and the novelty (Rieder; Matamoros-Fernández; Coromina, 2018).

Algorithms –that mathematical sequence of defined steps to solve questions and problems- play a leading role in our society, which has come to be defined as “civilization of algorithms” (Elías, 2015). And in the cultural field this prominence reaches singular relevance. We have delegated tasks in the algorithms (classify, filter, prioritize, and recommend) traditionally developed by qualified professionals in that field (gatekeeping and curation). We are used to their active presence in the conditioning of our cultural use, they go unnoticed, as a “technological subconscious” (Thrift, 2006). The digital basis of our daily life is also enigmatic because the entities that establish and exploit it do not reveal the totality of its technology or its algorithmic “heart”. Although algorithms are coated with certain rationality (Kitchin, 2018), these are the center of a technology that, in turn, responds to a business logic that includes objectives and ways of framing human actions.

That is why the scientific works that deal with algorithms and their social power abound; and, more specifically, their

impact on the choice of videos among the millions depo-

sited in the gigantic repository that constitutes YouTube. One of the most important uses of the algorithm includes the recommendations of videos that YouTube makes based on social consumption and the previous behavior of the identified users or in response to the questions

The YouTube algorithm automatically filters and recommends, a function traditionally managed by qualified professionals

they ask the platform.

Between broadcast yourself and broadcast whatever: YouTube’s homepage as a synthesis of its business strategy

But the algorithm is not the only element with outstanding involvement in the selection and recommendation of videos deposited on YouTube. Other actors also play a role, such as certain bloggers and some channels that feed their video content from the platform, or as the same publishers of the initial pages of YouTube –which guide their performances, among other criteria, set by their company. Google and YouTube are the ones who, above all, exercise the task of recommending what goes on the YouTube homepage (Gehl, 2009).

The continuing dominance of YouTube as the most visited platform for free consumption of online video is a result of its content offerings. For example, the initial page YouTube offers without prior registration or the “Trends”

The YouTube homepage represents the universe of content with which the company identifies itself

section, both of which represent an expression of the

brand identity and, therefore, the business perspective –even if YouTube claims not to have an editorial line. In this pa-

per we start with the assumption that YouTube’s homepage and the “Trends” section constitute a significant synthesis

of the policies followed by the company. The homepage –in general, the platform- is following advanced principles of

web design, usability, and navigability; and highlights content that affects its purpose of building audiences –based on

data on cultures of use- as well as other content that results from their business policies, which include agreements with

cultural and creative industries.

In its few years of existence, YouTube has explored several business models and lines of action in search of economic profitability. These lines include the creation and distribution of content produced by varied social actors, among which we could distinguish, for typological purposes, amateur-users from youtubers and other content creators who have found in this communication platform an area of professionalization as well as the cultural, traditional, or digital native industries.

In this work we also start from the assumption that viral memes, remixes, and mash-ups show a line of high interest for the business purposes of YouTube: the relationship of broad audiences with certain content and communicators born in the YouTube universe, which allow monetizing certain content generated by users. This is how YouTube contributes to its own professionalization, which has more than one million affiliates to its partner program, many of whom have millions of followers.

YouTube has followed an evolution that has moved from the content generated by amateur users to those professionally generated (Kim, 2012). Thus, without giving up its first philosophy linked to user videos, YouTube establishes its position in the market by associating these participatory cultural practices with the “YouTube brand”. Broadcast yourself is still their main slogan. But the business logic of YouTube has gradually marginalized the videos produced by those amateur users, so difficult to make profitable, and has granted greater interest to other producers, such as creators of increasingly professionalized content or the cultural and creative industries themselves.

The objective of this work is to analyze our main assumptions: that the unlogged YouTube homepage shows its business policy and its variations over time in the gradual displacement of content generated by amateur users through other content, generated in this case by professional producers. This work then seeks to investigate the relationship between the business strategy of YouTube, with its various bets for different business models, and the content to which YouTube gives greater visibility.

We believe that the changes observed on the YouTube homepage are in line with its business policy: the YouTube home does not respond to the Broadcast yourself slogan or to an alleged editorial impartiality. The variations that the homepage follows run parallel to the changes in the commercial strategies of the platform, from which an editorial decision is derived, motivated by business issues. To that end, we examine the evolution followed by the YouTube Spain homepage and the videos presented there, which have been produced by different types of users. We use on the Spanish page for the purpose of focusing our universe of study and obtaining a full and coherent sample, since the consumption of videos in different countries varies, conditioned by the cultural values of each country (Park et al., 2017). Specifically, we examine the evolution of the presence, on the YouTube homepage in Spain, of videos produced by amateur users, professionalized users, and cultural and creative industries. We also observe the changes introduced by YouTube in the selection criteria of the videos –reflected in the categories used to group them- that will obtain greater visibility through their presentation on the initial page.

2. In search of profit: YouTube and its business models

YouTube has been part of the services and products offered by Google since 2006, as part of Alphabet Inc., a multinational corporation. At its origin, YouTube could have been defined as an online video platform created to share audiovisual content for free by users, without restrictions in terms of copyright. Burgess and Green (2009) described YouTube according to its various forms: a large volume website, a broadcast distribution platform, a media archive, and a social network, while representing a disruption in the media business model, such as a new space of media power.

The disruptive nature of the platform concluded with the purchase by Google, with clear objectives:
- to convert it into the video reference platform on the internet; - to integrate it within the structure of the creative industries in a legal manner; - to achieve profitability on the investment made.

The first objectives were achieved by consolidating the second most visited website in the world (Alexa, 2018) and positioning its brand as a cross-platform audiovisual reference for the content of creative users and cultural industries. However, in terms of commercial profitability, some sources believe it is impossible (Winkler, 2015; Patel, 2017), while others are more optimistic and emphasize the advantages of positioning the platform between cultural industries and the professionalized user (Cunningham; Craig; Silver, 2016).

Participatory culture can be considered the core of the YouTube business (Burgess; Green, 2018). It has ceased to be a website for sharing video and is instead a platform for the creation and dissemination of content with a goal of economic profitability (Holland, 2016). This has meant that successful creators are now understood as brands (brand culture) with multiplatform production strategies that include traditional media (Holland, 2016; Cunningham; Craig, 2017). Cunningham and Craig (2017) call such proto-industry social media entertainment based on the former amateur creators, adding other online communities and marking the differences with respect to the strategies of production, content and marketing of traditional media companies. The debate about participatory culture moves towards the “platformization” of culture, an issue that implies both the mention of business models and the “datafication” of cultural consumption (Prey, 2016).

Throughout its evolution, each surface of YouTube has been opened to the market (Lobato, 2016). YouTube is committed to a wide and simultaneous range of complementary business models that reinforce each other. Its main business model is based on the AVOD (ad-supported video on demand) modality within the VOD (video on demand) (Prado, 2017), offering access to a catalog in an unlimited and free-way, financed through the advertising.

Unlike other OTT companies with business models based on subscription and pay-per-view, YouTube bases its commercial success on user activity and advertising. This hinders its profitability. Its strong positioning is linked to the consumption of free video financed with advertising and the content created by the user conditions the achievement of profits. The content of cultural industries is a safe value for advertisers (Lobato, 2016), compared to the content generated by users, which is less predictable and dependent on the associations created by YouTube algorithms.

The evolution in the strategic decisions of YouTube shows a search for the professionalization of content and a greater commerciality. Since 2007, after the purchase by Google, YouTube has introduced advertising videos as a form of financing and in 2009 founded Vevo, together with the main record labels, as a subsidiary platform dedicated to music.

Since 2011, the YouTube Partner Program (YPP) has made it possible for users to receive part of the revenue generated by their content, which in practice means an investment in the production of their users with better results in terms of visualizations. The monetization of the content, according to Postigo (2014), creates a narrative of accumulation that is contrary to the disinterested previous values of the community of users. It also leads to the creation of MCNs (Multi Channel Networks) or channel networks, as intermediaries that help to professionalize production and management in order to provide creators with better commercial results.

The conditions of entry in the YouTube Partner Program hardened in January 2018, supposedly to help the most valued creators to obtain more income. In practice it means a bet to limit the investment to the most attractive content. This action is consistent with user demand: 85% of the viewings are concentrated in 3% of the channels, which leads to the phenomenon rich-get-richer (Bärtl, 2018).

YouTube initiated various formulas to monetize content in 2013 and 2014. Between May 2013 and the end of 2017, it offered subscription packages to the payment channels in the United States. The cancellation of the

The categories of the YouTube homepage are in a state of permanent transformation

initiative reveals its failure and prepares the transition

to YouTube Premium. In 2014, the Fan Funding program established a voluntary financing model for creators, a crowd-

funding model, in other words. Not very popular, it would be replaced in 2017 by Super Chat to finance live streamings.

Other initiatives were the introduction of YouTube Music in October 2015 (music content app) and YouTube Red in four countries (access with payment without advertising), with hardly any success (Singleton, 2016).

The YouTube Movies and YouTube TV Show products, integrated into the YouTube portal since 2015, would correspond to a TVOD business model (transactional video on demand, limited-time rental, or permanent purchase with micro-payments).

Since 2015, the YouTube Gaming subscription platform deals with videogames, offering an app with various services and access to live gameplays broadcasts.

In 2017 YouTube TV starts its operations as Linear OTT (subscription to linear television channels through the internet for a base price of $40 per month), beginning with just the US market, in direct competition with cable television.

The YouTube ecosystem changed again in 2018 with the conversion of YouTube Red into YouTube Premium (with an SVOD model, subscription video on demand) and what seems like a determined investment for the own production in

the so-called YouTube Originals, following the steps of Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon. In parallel, YouTube Music is recast as YouTube Music Premium, with a subscription business model.
YouTube is thus betting on multiple simultaneous business models with different services and content that aim to be additional. In any case, it moves away from its foundational claim of a participatory culture (Lobato, 2016). The actions of YouTube are therefore directed towards an economic model of the “platformization”, in which different communities, media, and supports coexist with a broader and more ambitious business concept behind the brands/channels of success.
In the current model of YouTube converge the dual logics of community and commerce, broadcast distribution, and social media (Burgess; Green, 2018), as commercial hybrid space (Arthurs; Drakopoulou; Gandini, 2018). The monetization of the platform reproduces the dependence on traditional media advertising and its inefficiency, but adds the possibilities and effectiveness of online analysis (Cunningham; Craig; Silver, 2016), that is, the advantages of “datification”.
Despite the platform’s obvious marketing strategies towards profitable subscription-based business models, YouTube maintains the Broadcast yourself slogan and its web 2.0 brand identity created by and for the user: it is presented as a neutral web service to see and share content and not as a content producer itself (Burgess; Green, 2018). The contradiction of its commercial objectives with the alleged brand identity is a consequence of YouTube’s moment of transition between who it was and who it wants to be and the situation of the online audiovisual industry, an enormous rivalry. The logic of “pivot or die” (Cunningham; Craig; Silver 2016) is imposed on their strategic decisions.
3. Material and methods
The proposed methodological approach is very close to the approach of the digital methods of Rogers (2015), because we also seek to address the medium to study the cultural and social phenomena of the Web, that is, to observe the methods of the medium, integrated into the heart of these online instruments. Thus, it is possible to focus on the internal logic that YouTube follows, in the very categories and processes that this platform adopts within its algorithmic technology to organize and present information.
Among the wide and varied range of social actors that upload videos to YouTube, with the aim of typological simplification -and being aware of the inherent limitations of any taxonomy that reduces the complex reality to simple types- we have defined three categories of users/content producers:
-amateur users: do not pursue economic purposes, but entertainment or communication, and are not communication professionals. In contrast to other more worn-out terms, such as prosumer, we chose to recover that of emerec (emet­ teur-récepteur), used in 1973 by Cloutier (De-Aguilera-Gamoned; De-Aguilera-Moyano, 1989), which reflects more genuinely that social actor that receives messages but also elaborates and spreads its own with technological means;
-pro-am (Leadbeater; Miller, 2004): those users who, being initially amateur, have professionalized their activity outside the industry -as well as other content generators born in any case in the YouTube universe-. They possess advanced communicational knowledge, handling of digital technologies and specialized knowledge that has allowed them an appreciable degree of visibility. For our analysis, in this category we include users with more than 1,000 followers, one of the requirements to participate in the YouTube Partner Program.
- cultural and creative industries (CCI): both traditional and digital natives. - we added a fourth section called “others”, with those videos not included in the previous categories, such as those
produced by government actors, companies from other sectors, or videos not available or eliminated by the platform due to non-compliance with copyright, broken links, etc.
We use a quantitative research methodology with an exploratory and descriptive scope, based on the content analysis of the YouTube Spain homepage without registering (logging in). The tool used to access the primary sources is the Wayback Machine website (Internet Archive, 2018) that allows access to the different records or screenshots made by the self-described Internet Archive on the website object of study. https://archive.org/web https://www.youtube.com/es
The universe of the research is made up of all YouTube Spain homepages between June 2007 and July 2018.
The population of the research consists of the records documented by Internet Archive through Wayback Machine, adding a total of 656 screenshots collected between 7 February 2009 and 11 July 2018, there are no captures prior to this first date in the Internet Archive. From this population we extract a representative sample of 20 captures, 1 per semester, chosen randomly, ascending to a total of 674 videos contained and analyzed in these homepages1.
Of the possible variables that we can find we are interested in the presence of social actors producing/creating content -emerec, pro-am and CCI-, as well as the sections, which sometimes coincide with the categories proposed by the plat­ form (YouTube currently distinguishes 15 categories of different “Genre” –for example: Entertainment, Music, News and politics...- to catalog the channels and videos that are uploaded to the platform) and in the remainder of the occa-

Recommendations) that have shaped the design of the homepages analyzed.

The technique of quantitative content analysis applied to the study consists of a first observation phase in which the referred data to the type of uploader or user that uploads videos and are coded, by viewing them, according to the second variable: the section or category of the homepage on which they are included.

This first part ends with the corresponding statistical analysis and exploitation of the results. In a second phase the focus is on the evolution of the sections or categories regardless of the type of producer, identifying the periods in which they have been active on the homepage. In summary, in the analysis performed, in order to observe the changes in the business strategy of YouTube, we look for relationships between the evolution of the categories and users/producers throughout the period analyzed.

but it disappeared in 2017. For the

present analysis we have limited the videos to those that are visible on the homepage by vertical scroll, ignoring other

submenus. The total number, reflected in graph 1, remains stable over the last four years.

Pro-am users are the largest contributors of audiovisual content in the total of the period analyzed (280 videos) followed closely by the CCI (238 videos) and the emerec, with a minimum weight on the home pages (73 videos) but with a very significant evolution (Annex 1).

We propose three time segments based on key moments in the evolution of the YouTube homepage with respect to users/producers and categories.

4.1. First stage: Emergence of the UGC (user generated content) (2009 - first semester 2012)

If we focus on its temporal evolution (graph 2), we observe a first stage that coincides with the beginning of the platform characterized by an exponential growth of users. In this context it is the emerec and pro-am users who account for most of the homepages. The cultural and creative industries or CCI are practically absent, except for the record industry.

In this first emergent stage, from its beginning until the first semester of 2012, the videos are grouped into categories of genre along with others that we call functional, suggesting the viewing of videos under concepts such as “Featured Videos” or “Trends”.

The following graph shows the same evolution of the number of videos –now expressed as a percentage- included according to the three main types of actors on the platform, with which we can observe the importance of each one of them regardless of the total number of videos.

the most common genres, video games are the top content category of the pro-am.

4.3. Third stage: The consolidation of the CCI (first semester 2015 - present)

Starting in 2012 the presence of CCIs increased (figures 2 and 3), but from 2015 until the present it has held more relative weight. Since its inception, music has been the main sector of the CCI, even after the birth of Vevo in 2009. Since 2014, the appearance of Vevo content in the form of channels has been significant.

Other sectors of the CCI have been integrated into the platform as content producers (media, film, or videogame industry). The most common format with which they are presented on the homepage are recommended channels, themes,

and highlights. In terms of content or gender categories, it should be noted that CCIs have become the main producer in the music category.
The CCIs went from occupying about 10% of videos in the first years to more than 50% in the most recent samples analyzed. If these data from the homepages are extrapolated to the YouTube set, they could reflect the progressive integration of the CCI in the digital sphere, especially in audiovisual platforms.

Between broadcast yourself and broadcast whatever: YouTube’s homepage as a synthesis of its business strategy

Topics: the automatic generation channels

In 2018 the “Theme” or “Recommended theme channel” arises, a result of the evolution of the different algorithms that converge on the YouTube homepage in the category configuration. The “Theme” groups videos and thematic channels generated automatically by the algorithm “when a topic is detected that has a considerable presence on the website” (YouTube, 2018). This qualitative advance in the design of the algorithm shows the tendency of the platform to full automation by providing the most appropriate content according to its criteria. It also shows the progressive use of user information extracted from its digital uses.

5. Discussion and conclusions

YouTube appeared as a platform that represented participatory culture. However, the results of this research corroborate the idea that YouTube soon left behind the

YouTube’s algorithm is another marketing resource

dream of a philanthropic and collaborative web –which

so influenced the first studies about this platform (Arthurs; Drokopoulou; Gandini, 2018)-, in order to orient itself to-

wards the creation and diffusion of audiovisual content following commercially profitable objectives (Holland, 2016).

Imposing the application of business models that took advantage of its positioning as a key brand of the online audiovi-

sual, to successfully migrate from the Broadcast yourself to a Broadcast whatever in which profitability is avidly pursued.

At its core is model that has given fabulous results to Google: filter, sort, select, prioritize, and recommend selected

content over others.

The already abundant literature about YouTube accounts for the different facets that authors like Burgess and Green (2009) have rightly attributed to this platform. Bearing in mind several of these authors we have focused on their business models in relation to the content offered by YouTube to its users, classifying that content according to who their producers were. The method we develop responds to the specific aims of our research and to a precise object of study –the content offered by YouTube on its unregistered homepage, concentrating on the visible videos through vertical scrolling, ignoring other submenus- allowing us to reach certain conclusions. But it also helps us to think and propose new questions, among other issues, relating to the incidence of this platform in the production, dissemination, and consumption of cultural products, thus emphasizing our attention to issues of considerable importance in social research.

The content offered by YouTube on its unregistered homepage represents the symbolic universe of content with which the company identifies itself, in addition to using an editing model that confronts with YouTube’s communication policy, which still highlights the communicative centrality of the user. The variations in the content offered by YouTube on its initial page show an open intention to link the identity of the platform with certain products and creators, over others. The objective is to give greater visibility to more attractive content for consumers, thus moving forward in the construction of their audiences.

The results of the analysis show an evolution of the sections and categories that classify and filter the content of the homepage. Therefore, we found there is ongoing experimentation, with a mutant platform model in several aspects.

At the same time, we discovered a direct relationship between the changes in their business models and the evolution of the number of videos on the homepage according to the type of producer and the categories –in line with the institutionalization process of this platform that Kim pointed out (2012)-. Consequently, we conclude that the YouTube homepage is a significant synthesis of the company’s policy.

We identify different stages in YouTube’s commercial and communication strategies:
- foundational stage between 2005 and 2006 that responds to the principles and values of collaborative production in the web 2.0;
- between 2007 and 2010 Google tries to make the platform profitable through agreements with the CCI and increases the presence of advertising, without losing the production of the emerec as the main identity;
- between 2011 and 2014 YouTube is strongly committed to the pro-am in its business models and in the number of videos and categories of its initial page;
- between 2015 and 2018 it is perceived -as Cunningham, Craig, and Silver (2016) mentioned- that there was a greater commitment to the visibility of the CCI, in parallel with the prominence of the pro-am content. Since 2015, the platform has been promoting channels with different payment models linked to professional content and more professional pro-am;
- 2017 and 2018 the content of emerec users was practically banished from the YouTube homepage while a balanced promotion of the content of ICC and pro-am users took place. Previous proposals for various payment products converge on YouTube Premium and lead to the commitment to own production (YouTube Originals), like other OTT platforms.

We venture that YouTube will continue to delve into a search for profits through the production and dissemination of audiovisual content. Among them, the content generated by non-professional users will remain almost without any protagonism, while those generated by the proto-industry (Cunningham; Craig, 2017) built around the pro-am will maintain

some prominence. Although possibly decreasing, YouTube Premium has the highest potential to attract profits, and the YouTube algorithm and its home page would adapt to this possiblity.
