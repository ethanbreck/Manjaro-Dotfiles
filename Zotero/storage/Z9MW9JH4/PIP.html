 1970 and was widely reprinted and passed around the Movement and beyond

around until I did a Google search and found it being discussed in many 
different languages. </span></p>

 Shulie Firestone and Anne Koedt after Kathie Sarachild brought it to 
their attention as a possible paper to be printed in that early 
collection. Also, “political” was used here in the broad sense of the 
word as having to do with power relationships, not the narrow sense of 
electorial politics. </span></p>
      <p class="style1" style="line-height:17px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">The
 paper actually began as a memo that I wrote in February of 1969 while 
in Gainesville, Florida. It was sent to the women’s caucus of the 
Southern Conference Educational Fund (SCEF) a group for whom I was a 
subsistence-paid organizer doing exploratory work for establishing a 
women’s liberation project in the South. The memo was originally titled,
 “Some Thoughts in Response to Dottie’s Thoughts on a Women’s Liberation
 Movement,” and was written in reply to a memo by another staff member, 
Dottie Zellner, who contended that consciousness-raising was just 
therapy and questioned whether the new independent WLM was really 
“political.” </span></p>
      <p class="style1" style="line-height:17px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">This
 was not an unusual reaction to radical feminist ideas in early 1969. 
WLM groups had been springing up all over the country—and the world. The
 radical movements of Civil Rights, Anti-Vietnam War, and Old and New 
Left groups from which many of us sprang were male dominated and very 
nervous about women’s liberation in general, but especially the spectre 
of the mushrooming independent women’s liberation movement, of which I 
was a staunch advocate. Arriving in New York City after ten months in 
the Mississippi Civil Rights Movement, I had found SCEF to be one of the
 more mature and better progressive groups around. It had a good record 
of racial, economic and political justice work since New Deal days, and I
 joined its staff in 1966 as its New York office manager. SCEF allowed 
New York Radical Women to meet in its New York office, where I worked, 
and at my request agreed to explore setting up a women’s liberation 
project in the South. However, many on the SCEF staff, both men and 
women, ended up joining the criticism of women getting together in 
consciousness-raising groups to discuss their own oppression as 
“naval-gazing” and “personal therapy”—and certainly “not political.” </span></p>
      <p class="style1" style="line-height:17px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">They
 could sometimes admit that women were oppressed (but only by “the 
system”) and said that we should have equal pay for equal work, and some
 other “rights.” But they belittled us no end for trying to bring our 
so-called “personal problems” into the public arena—especially “all 
those body issues” like sex, appearance, and abortion. Our demands that 
men share the housework and childcare were likewise deemed a personal 
problem between a woman and her individual man. The opposition claimed 
if women would just “stand up for themselves” and take more 
responsibility for their own lives, they wouldn’t need to have an 
independent movement for women’s liberation. What personal initiative 
wouldn’t solve, they said, “the revolution” would take care of if we 
would just shut up and do our part. Heaven forbid that we should point 
out that men benefit from oppressing women. </span></p>
      <p class="style1" style="line-height:17px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">Recognizing the need to fight male supremacy as a movement instead of blaming the individual </span><span style=" font-weight:normal"><span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">woman
 for her oppression was where the Pro-Woman Line came in. It challenged 
the old anti-woman line that used spiritual, psychological, 
metaphysical, and pseudo-historical explanations for women’s oppression 
with a real, materialist analysis for why women do what we do. (By 
materialist, I mean in the Marxist materialist (based in reality) sense,
 not in the “desire for consumer goods” sense.) Taking the position that
 “women are messed over, not messed up” took the focus off individual 
struggle and put it on group or class struggle, exposing the necessity 
for an independent WLM to deal with male supremacy. </span></span></p>
      <p class="style1" style="line-height:17px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">The
 Pro-Woman Line also helped challenge the “sex role theory” of women’s 
oppression that said women act as we do because “that’s how we were 
taught” by “society.” (We all can think of things we were taught to 
think or do that we rejected once the forces that kept us thinking or 
doing them were removed.) It was consciousness-raising that led to the 
emergence of the Pro-Woman Line with its scientific explanation based on
 an analysis of our own experiences and an examination of “who benefits”
 from women’s oppression. Understanding that our oppressive situations 
were not our own fault—were not, in the parlance of the time, “all in 
our head”—gave us a lot more courage as well as a more solid, real 
foundation on which to fight for liberation. </span></p>
      <p class="style1" style="line-height:17px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">“The
 Personal is Political” paper and the theory it contains, was my 
response in the heat of the battle to the attacks on us by SCEF and the 
rest of the radical movement. I think it’s important to realize that the
 paper came out of struggle—not just my struggle in SCEF but the 
struggle of the independent WLM against those who were trying to either 
stop it or to push it into directions they found less threatening. </span></p>
      <p class="style1" style="line-height:17px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">It’s
 also important to realize the theory the paper contains did not come 
solely out of my individual brain. It came out of a movement (the 
Women’s Liberation Movement) and a specific group within that movement 
(New York Radical Women) and a specific group of women within New York 
Radical Women, sometimes referred to as the Pro-Woman Line faction. </span></p>
      <p class="style1" style="line-height:17px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">Of
 course there were women within New York Radical Women and the broader 
feminist movement who argued from the beginning against consciousness 
raising and claimed women were brainwashed and complicit in their own 
oppression, an argument rooted in the sociological and psychological 
rather than the political. They, too, helped in the formulation of 
Pro-Woman Line theory. By arguing the then “standard wisdom” against us,
 they forced us to clarify and hone and develop and refine and 
articulate the new theory so that it could be spread more widely. After 
New York Radical Women meetings, the Pro-Woman Line faction would 
usually end up at Miteras, a nearby restaurant that served fantastic 
apple pie a la mode. There we would discuss how the meeting had gone and
 the ideas that had been talked about until two or three in the morning,
 both agreeing with and challenging each other in wonderful, lively 
debate among ourselves. </span></p>
      <p class="style1" style="line-height:17px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">In
 September of 1968—six months before “The Personal Is Political” was 
written, the Miss America Protest brought home to many why the Pro-Woman
 Line theory we were developing was so important when it came to taking 
action outside the group. In another paper entitled “A Critique of the 
Miss America Protest” I wrote about how the anti-women faction of the 
protesters detracted from our message that ALL women are oppressed by 
beauty standards, even the contestants. Signs like “Up Against the Wall,
 Miss America” and “Miss America Is a Big Falsie” made these contestants
 out to be our enemy instead of the men and bosses who imposed false 
beauty standards on women. </span></p>
      <p class="style1" style="line-height:17px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">Political
 struggle or debate is the key to good political theory. A theory is 
just a bunch of words— sometimes interesting to think about, but just 
words, nevertheless—until it is tested in real life. Many a theory has 
delivered surprises, both positive and negative, when an attempt has 
been made to put it into practice. </span></p>
      <p class="style1" style="line-height:17px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">While
 trying to think how I would change “The Personal Is Political” paper if
 I could rewrite it with today’s hindsight, I was actually surprised how
 well it stands the test of time and experience. There are a few things I
 would elaborate on, like my simplistic definition of class, and there 
are a few statements in the paper that are badly in need of further 
development. Perhaps the two that bothers me the most are: “Women are 
smart not to struggle alone” and “It is no worse to be in the home than 
in the rat race of the job world.” </span></p>
      <p class="style1" style="line-height:17px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">The
 first statement doesn’t mean that women are smart not to struggle at 
all, as some have interpreted the Pro-Woman Line. Women are </span><span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">sometimes </span><span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">smart
 not to struggle alone when they can’t win and the repercussions are 
worse than the oppression. However, individual struggle does sometimes 
get us some things, and when the WLM is at low tide or invisible, it may
 be the best we can do. We need to always be pushing the envelope. Even 
when the WLM is at high tide, because our oppression often takes place 
in isolated circumstances like the home, it still takes individual 
action to put into practice what the Movement is fighting for. But 
individual struggle is </span><span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">always </span><span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">limited; it’s going to takes an ongoing Movement stronger than any we’ve seen so far to put an end to male supremacy. </span></p>
      <p class="style1" style="line-height:17px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">On
 the second point, I have come to agree with Susan B. Anthony that to be
 free, a woman must have “a purse of her own.” Women can’t be 
independent without participating in the public workforce. That also 
means uniting in a fight for public childcare and for a restructuring of
 the workplace with women’s equality in mind, while insisting men share 
the housework and childcare on the homefront, so that women don’t end up
 having to do it all. </span></p>
    <p class="style1" style="line-height:17px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">I
 wish we could have anticipated all the ways that “The Personal Is 
Political” and “The Pro-Woman Line” would be revised and misused. Like 
most of the theory created by the Pro-Woman Line radical feminists, 
these ideas have been revised or ripped off or even stood on their head 
and used against their original, radical intent. While it’s necessary 
that theories take their knocks in the real world, like everything else,
 many of us have learned that once they leave our hands, they need to be
 defended against revisionism and misuse. </span></p>      <p class="style1" style="margin-bottom:25px; line-height:17px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">What follows is the original version of “The Personal Is Political” as edited from the memo for the 1970 anthology, </span><span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">Notes from the Second Year: Women’s Liberation</span><span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">, edited by Shulamith Firestone and Anne Koedt. </span><span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">— Carol Hanisch </span></p>

        <p style="margin-bottom:19px; line-height:19px" align="left"> <span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">For
 this paper I want to stick pretty close to an aspect of the Left debate
 commonly talked about—namely “therapy” vs. “therapy and politics.” 
Another name for it is “personal” vs. “political” and it has other 
names, I suspect, as it has developed across the country. I haven’t 
gotten over to visit the New Orleans group yet, but I have been 
participating in groups in New York and Gainesville for more than a 
year. Both of these groups have been called “therapy” and “personal” 
groups by women who consider themselves “more political.” So I must 
speak about so-called therapy groups from my own experience. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:19px; line-height:19px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">The
 very word “therapy” is obviously a misnomer if carried to its logical 
conclusion. Therapy assumes that someone is sick and that there is a 
cure, e.g., a personal solution. I am greatly offended that I or any 
other woman is thought to need therapy in the first place. Women are 
messed over, not messed up! We need to change the objective conditions, 
not adjust to them. Therapy is adjusting to your bad personal 
alternative. </span></p>
<div class="Sect">
          <p style="margin-bottom:19px; line-height:19px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">We
 have not done much trying to solve immediate personal problems of women
 in the group. We’ve mostly picked topics by two methods: In a small 
group it is possible for us to take turns bringing questions to the 
meeting (like, Which do/did you prefer, a girl or a boy baby or no 
children, and why? What happens to your relationship if your man makes 
more money than you? Less than you?). Then we go around the room 
answering the questions from our personal experiences. Everybody talks 
that way. At the end of the meeting we try to sum up and generalize from
 what’s been said and make connections. </span></p>
</div>
        <p style="margin-bottom:19px; line-height:19px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">I
 believe at this point, and maybe for a long time to come, that these 
analytical sessions are a form of political action. I do not go to these
 sessions because I need or want to talk about my ”personal problems.” 
In fact, I would rather not. As a movement woman, I’ve been pressured to
 be strong, selfless, other-oriented, sacrificing, and in general pretty
 much in control of my own life. To admit to the problems in my life is 
to be deemed weak. So I want to be a strong woman, in movement terms, 
and not admit I have any real problems that I can’t find a personal 
solution to (except those directly related to the capitalist system). It
 is at this point a political action to tell it like it is, to say what I
 really believe about my life instead of what I’ve always been told to 
say. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:19px; line-height:19px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">So
 the reason I participate in these meetings is not to solve any personal
 problem. One of the first things we discover in these groups is that 
personal problems are political problems. There are no personal 
solutions at this time. There is only collective action for a collective
 solution. I went, and I continue to go to these meetings because I have
 gotten a political understanding which all my reading, all my 
“political discussions,” all my “political action,” all my four-odd 
years in the movement never gave me. I’ve been forced to take off the 
rose colored glasses and face the awful truth about how grim my life 
really is as a woman. I am getting a gut understanding of everything as 
opposed to the esoteric, intellectual understandings and </span><span style="font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">noblesse oblige </span><span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">feelings I had in “other people’s” struggles. </span></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom:19px; line-height:19px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">This
 is not to deny that these sessions have at least two aspects that are 
therapeutic. I prefer to call even this aspect “political therapy” as 
opposed to personal therapy. The most important is getting rid of 
self-blame. Can you imagine what would happen if women, blacks, and 
workers (my definition of worker is anyone who has to work for a living 
as opposed to those who don’t. All women are workers) would-stop blaming
 ourselves for our sad situations? It seems to me the whole country 
needs that kind of political therapy. That is what the black movement is
 doing in its own way. We shall do it in ours. We are only starting to 
stop blaming ourselves. We also feel like we are thinking for ourselves 
for the first time in our lives. As the cartoon in </span><span style="font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">Lilith </span><span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">puts
 it, “I’m changing. My mind is growing muscles.” Those who believe that 
Marx, Lenin, Engels, Mao, and Ho have the only and last “good word” on 
the subject and that women have nothing more to add will, of course, 
find these groups a waste of time. </span></p>
        <div class="Sect">
          <p style="margin-bottom:19px; line-height:19px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">The
 groups that I have been in have also not gotten into “alternative 
life-styles” or what it means to be a “liberated” woman. We came early 
to the conclusion that all alternatives are bad under present 
conditions. Whether we live with or without a man, communally or in 
couples or alone, are married or unmarried, live with other women, go 
for free love, celibacy or lesbianism, or any combination, there are 
only good and bad things about each bad situation. There is no “more 
liberated” way; there are only bad alternatives. </span></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom:19px; line-height:19px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">This
 is part of one of the most important theories we are beginning to 
articulate. We call it “the pro-woman line.” What it says basically is 
that women are really neat people. The bad things that are said about us
 as women are either myths (women are stupid), tactics women use to 
struggle individually (women are bitches), or are actually things that 
we want to carry into the new society and want men to share too (women 
are sensitive, emotional). Women as oppressed people act out of 
necessity (act dumb in the presence of men), not out of choice. Women 
have developed great shuffling techniques for their own survival (look 
pretty and giggle to get or keep a job or man) which should be used when
 necessary until such time as the power of unity can take its place. 
Women are smart not to struggle alone (as are blacks and workers). It is
 no worse to be in the home than in the rat race of the job world. They 
are both bad. Women, like blacks, workers, must stop blaming ourselves 
for our “failures.” </span></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom:19px; line-height:19px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">It
 took us some ten months to get to the point where we could articulate 
these things and relate them to the lives of every woman. It’s important
 from the standpoint of what kind of action we are going to do. When our
 group first started, going by majority opinion, we would have been out 
in the streets demonstrating against marriage, against having babies, 
for free love, against women who wore makeup, against housewives, for 
equality without recognition of biological differences, and god knows 
what else. Now we see all these things as what we call “personal 
solutionary.” Many of the actions taken by “action” groups have been 
along these lines. The women who did the anti-woman stuff at the Miss 
America Pageant were the ones who were screaming for action without 
theory. The members of one group want to set up a private daycare center
 without any real analysis of what could be done to make it better for 
little girls, much less any analysis of how that center hastens the 
revolution. </span></p>
</div>
        <p style="margin-bottom:19px; line-height:19px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">That
 is not to say, of course, that we shouldn’t do action. There may be 
some very good reasons why women in the group don’t want to do anything 
at the moment. One reason that I often have is that this thing is so 
important to me that I want to be very sure that we’re doing it the best
 way we know how, and that it is a “right” action that I feel sure 
about. I refuse to go out and “produce” for the movement. We had a lot 
of conflict in our New York group about whether or not to do action. 
When the Miss America Protest was proposed, there was no question but 
that we wanted to do, it. I think it was because we all saw how it 
related to our lives. We felt it was a good action. There were things 
wrong with the action, but the basic idea was there. </span></p>

 has been my experience in groups that are accused of being “therapy” or
 “personal.” Perhaps certain groups may well be attempting to do 
therapy. Maybe the answer is not to put down the method of analyzing 
from personal experiences in favor of immediate action, but to figure 
out what can be done to make it work. Some of us started to write a 
handbook about this at one time and never got past the outline. We are 
working on it again, and hope to have it out in a month at the latest. </span></p>

          <p style="margin-bottom:19px; line-height:19px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">It’s
 true we all need to learn how to better draw conclusions from the 
experiences and feelings we talk about and how to draw all kinds of 
connections. Some of us haven’t done a very good job of communicating 
them to others. </span></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom:30px; line-height:19px" align="justify"> <span style="font-size:11pt; font-weight:normal; color:#000000">One
 more thing: I think we must listen to what so-called apolitical women 
have to say—not so we can do a better job of organizing them but because
 together we are a mass movement. I think we who work full-time in the 
movement tend to become very narrow. What is happening now is that when 
non-movement women disagree with us, we assume it’s because they are 
“apolitical,” not because there might be something wrong with our 
thinking. Women have left the movement in droves. The obvious reasons 
are that we are tired of being sex slaves and doing shitwork for men 
whose hypocrisy is so blatant in their political stance of liberation 
for everybody (else). But there is really a lot more to it than that. I 
can’t quite articulate it yet. I think “apolitical” women are not in the
 movement for very good reasons, and as long as we say “you have to 
think like us and live like us to join the charmed circle,” we will 
fail. What I am trying to say is that there are things in the 
consciousness of “apolitical” women (I find them very political) that 
are as valid as any political consciousness we think we have. We should 
figure out why many women don’t want to do action. Maybe there is 
something wrong with the action or something wrong with why we are doing
 the action or maybe the analysis of why the action is necessary is not 
clear enough in our minds. </span></p>
