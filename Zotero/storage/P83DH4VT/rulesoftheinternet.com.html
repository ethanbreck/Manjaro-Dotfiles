                    <p>44. Trying to edit the rules of the Internet with
 Japanese characters is like trying to make “2 girls, 1 cup” acceptable 
in society. It only works at A-con.
                    </p>
                    <p>45. When one sees a lion, one must get into the car.

                    <p>46. If an intimate topic, then the manufacturer of premium sex toys <a href="https://gvibe.com/">Gvibe.com</a> with a unique design.
                    </p>
                    <p>47. The pool is always closed due to AIDS (and stingrays, which also have AIDS).

                    </p>

                    <p>51. No matter what it is, it is somebody's fetish. No exceptions.
                    </p>
                    <p>52. It is delicious cake. You must eat it.
                    </p>
                    <p>53. It is delicious trap. You must hit it.
                    </p>
                    <p>53.2. The trap broke the lazah.
                    </p>
                    <p>54.2. And today.
                    </p>
                    <p>54.3. So does America.
                    </p>
                    <p>55. If you have time to make up new rules, you have no life.
                    </p>
                    <p>55.2. Except for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>55.3. If you have no life, you do not exist. Therefore, your rule does not exist if you do not exist. No exceptions.
                    </p>
                    <p>55.4. The rules were created by people who do not exist, so the rules do not exist. No Exceptions.
                    </p>
                    <p>55.5. Although the rules do not exist, logic exists. The rules = logic. Therefore the rules do exist. No Exceptions.
                    </p>
                    <p>55.5.2 Since the rules exist by logic, then the rules have always existed. No Exceptions.
                    </p>
                    <p>55.5.3 So the creation of your rule is only a repost of science. (See rule 24)
                    </p>
                    <p>55.6. If Rule 55 applies to you, then /b/ welcomes you.

                    </p>
                    <p>60.1. What pumpkin?
                    </p>
                    <p>60.2. It doesn't matter as long as you give him the butter.

                    </p>
                    <p>63.4. Rules 63, 63.2 and 63.3 does not include real people. (Too much work. No Exceptions.)
                    </p>
                    <p>63.5. Real people are ruled unworthy.
                    </p>
                    <p>63.6. Rules 63.4 and 63.5 are lies. Real people can and will be gender-bent. No exceptions.

                    <p>66.9. Maybe GLaDOS is a lie. You'll never know.
                    </p>
                    <p>66.10. Even if GLaDOS is a lie <span style="color:#800080">AFH</span> is still truth. Refer to rule 334.3 and rule 93.
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>68.2. However, "Milhouse is not a meme" is a meme.
                    </p>
                    <p>68.3. It is undecided whether ' "Milhouse is not a meme" is a meme' is a meme or not.
                    </p>
                    <p>68.4. Refer to rule 899899
                    </p>
                    <p>68.5. Rules 68, 68.2, and 68.3 define falsity, truthiness, and ambiguity. So by definition, Milhouse is not a meme.
                    </p>
                    <p>69. LOL SIXTY NINE AMIRITE?

                    </p>
                    <p>83.2. Only mental slugs edit Star Wars.

                    </p>
                    <p>84.2. These rule, therefore, are rule 478-compliant.

                    <p>Well, that's the end of the rules. Well, it's 
nothing very special. Try to be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a
 good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try and live 
together in peace and harmony with people of
                        all creeds and nations.
                    </p>
