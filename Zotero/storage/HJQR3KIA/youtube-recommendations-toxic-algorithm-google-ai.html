This is what YouTube was made for, and it\u2019s beautiful. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, as YouTube has become\u00a0the place for videos on the web, it\u2019s led to a raft of new problems. Content moderation is a constant struggle and YouTube can do better, but there will likely always be some amount of offensive videos that people can seek out. However, the real issue is the videos we don\u2019t seek out: YouTube\u2019s recommendations. \r\n[in-content-unit]\r\nRecommendations are a waste of time\r\nYou can see the recommendations in the \u201cUp next\u201d list on the right of the screen and they\u2019ll also play automatically when you\u2019ve got autoplay enabled. \r\n\r\nThese are the videos you should be wary of, according to Guillaume Chaslot. He's the founder of\u00a0a project to demand greater transparency from online platforms called AlgoTransparency, and used to work at Google on YouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithm. He says the motivations behind it are deeply flawed as it isn\u2019t really about what the viewer wants.\r\n\r\n[caption id=&quot;attachment_1212727&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;796&quot;] Chaslot speaking at the DisinfoLab Conference in Brussels[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t inherently awful that YouTube uses AI to recommend video for you, because if the AI is well tuned it can help you get what you want. This would be amazing,\u201d Chaslot told TNW. \u201cBut the problem is that the AI isn\u2019t built to help you get what you want -- it\u2019s built to get you addicted to YouTube. Recommendations were designed to waste your time.\u201d\r\n\r\nChaslot explains that the metric the algorithm uses to determine a \u2018successful\u2019 recommendations is watch time. This might be great for a company trying to sell ads, but doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect what the user wants -- and has grave side-effects. \r\nEngaging content gets recommended, which is bad\r\nDuring his talk at the DisinfoLab Conference last month, Chaslot noted that divisive and sensational content is often recommended widely: conspiracy theories, fake news, flat-Earther videos, for example. Basically, the closer it stays the edge of what's allowed under YouTube\u2019s policy, the more engagement it gets. Google completely disagrees with Chaslot, but we'll get to that later.\r\n\r\nThe basic structure of YouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithm might\u2019ve worked fine for its core types of content -- like cat videos, gaming, and music. But as YouTube becomes more central in people\u2019s information and news consumption, Chaslot worries recommendations will push people further to extremes -- whether they want it or not -- just because it\u2019s in YouTube\u2019s interest to keep us watching for as long as possible. \r\n\r\n[caption id=&quot;attachment_1212704&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;592&quot;] Chaslot\u2019s take on Facebook\u2019s natural engagement pattern: \u201cThe best way to use social media is to surf the policy line.\u201d[\/caption]\r\n\r\nMark Zuckerberg admitted last year that borderline content was more engaging. Google did not want to answer TNW\u2019s questions as to whether the same was true for YouTube, but the company\u2019s spokesperson said in a discussion at the DisinfoLab conference that the company's studies showed people actually engaged more with quality content. Chaslot says this is something the big tech companies will have to debate between themselves, but based on his own experience, he\u2019s more inclined to believe Zuckerberg at this point.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to realize that YouTube recommendations are toxic and it perverts civic discussion,\u201d says Chaslot. \u201cRight now the incentive is to create this type of borderline content that\u2019s very engaging, but not forbidden.\u201d Basically, the more outlandish content you make, the more likely it\u2019ll keep people watching, which in turn will make it more likely to be recommended by the algorithm -- which results in greater revenue for the creator, and for YouTube.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut what about actual, concrete examples of problematic recommendations? \r\nWhen recommendations go wrong\r\nIn Chaslot\u2019s mind, it should be enough to point out that the algorithm\u2019s incentives are completely broken (i.e. watch time doesn\u2019t equal quality) as an example of why it\u2019s bad for us as a society. But to actually show its effects, he made the AlgoTransparency tool after he left Google. The tool is meant to give people a better overview of what\u2019s actually being recommended on YouTube. \r\n\r\nBasically, it tries to find out which videos are shared by most channels to provide an overview you can\u2019t get through your personal browsing. Chaslot points out that most often, the top recommended videos are innocuous, but every now and again, problematic videos pop up.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis video funded by the Russian government was recommended more than half a million times from more than 236 different channels.https:\/\/t.co\/aRNUx2WIOm\r\n2\/\r\n\r\n\u2014 Guillaume Chaslot (@gchaslot) April 26, 2019\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Mueller report detailing whether there was any collusion between Russia and Donald Trump's presidential campaign was released, Chaslot noticed that the analysis recommended from the most channels was a video from RT -- a state-sponsored Russian propaganda outlet. \r\n\r\nThat means that if Chaslot is correct, YouTube\u2019s algorithm amplified a video explaining the finding on possible Russian collusion made by\u2026 Russia. The video upholds what could be considered a Kremlin-friendly narrative and slams mainstream media. Naturally, Chaslot\u2019s claim caught the attention of the media and was covered widely.\r\n\r\nChaslot says that while other Mueller-related videos got more total recommendations, the RT video stood out because it was recommended like crazy for two days and then nothing -- despite having relatively few views. \r\n\r\n\u201cIt was really strange to see this amount of channels that recommended this video, compared to how many views it had,\u201d says Chaslot \u201cThe weird thing is that nobody really understands why this happened.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow it's important to get Google's side of things. Google has completely disowned AlgoTransparency's methodology (which you can find here) and told TNW it doesn't accurately reflect how recommendations work -- which are based on surveys, likes, dislikes, and shares.\r\nAs with most assertions made by AlgoTransparency, we have been unable to reproduce the results here. We\u2019ve designed our systems to help ensure that content from more authoritative sources is surfaced prominently in search results and watch next recommendations in certain contexts, including when a viewer is watching news related content on YouTube.\r\nChaslot says that if there are discrepancies with his results, he'd love to know what they are. And the best way to do that, is for Google to simply share which videos YouTube is recommending to people. But the company hasn\u2019t revealed more information on the matter.\r\n\r\nChaslot also points out that it seems his methods manage to highlight similar faults in the algorithm as Google does.

<meta property="bt:body" content="Where else could you go for you daily dose of how-tos, like this one about draining washing machines, or 15-minute compilations of cats vomiting? This is what YouTube was made for, and it’s beautiful. 

At the same time, as YouTube has become&nbsp;the place for videos on the web, it’s led to a raft of new problems. Content moderation is a constant struggle and YouTube can do better, but there will likely always be some amount of offensive videos that people can seek out. However, the real issue is the videos we don’t seek out: YouTube’s recommendations. 
[in-content-unit]
Recommendations are a waste of time
You can see the recommendations in the “Up next” list on the right of the screen and they’ll also play automatically when you’ve got autoplay enabled. 

These are the videos you should be wary of, according to Guillaume Chaslot. He's the founder of&nbsp;a project to demand greater transparency from online platforms called AlgoTransparency, and used to work at Google on YouTube’s recommendation algorithm. He says the motivations behind it are deeply flawed as it isn’t really about what the viewer wants.

[caption id=&quot;attachment_1212727&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;796&quot;] Chaslot speaking at the DisinfoLab Conference in Brussels[/caption]

“It isn’t inherently awful that YouTube uses AI to recommend video for you, because if the AI is well tuned it can help you get what you want. This would be amazing,” Chaslot told TNW. “But the problem is that the AI isn’t built to help you get what you want -- it’s built to get you addicted to YouTube. Recommendations were designed to waste your time.”

Chaslot explains that the metric the algorithm uses to determine a ‘successful’ recommendations is watch time. This might be great for a company trying to sell ads, but doesn’t necessarily reflect what the user wants -- and has grave side-effects. 
Engaging content gets recommended, which is bad
During his talk at the DisinfoLab Conference last month, Chaslot noted that divisive and sensational content is often recommended widely: conspiracy theories, fake news, flat-Earther videos, for example. Basically, the closer it stays the edge of what's allowed under YouTube’s policy, the more engagement it gets. Google completely disagrees with Chaslot, but we'll get to that later.

The basic structure of YouTube’s recommendation algorithm might’ve worked fine for its core types of content -- like cat videos, gaming, and music. But as YouTube becomes more central in people’s information and news consumption, Chaslot worries recommendations will push people further to extremes -- whether they want it or not -- just because it’s in YouTube’s interest to keep us watching for as long as possible. 

[caption id=&quot;attachment_1212704&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;592&quot;] Chaslot’s take on Facebook’s natural engagement pattern: “The best way to use social media is to surf the policy line.”[/caption]

Mark Zuckerberg admitted last year that borderline content was more engaging. Google did not want to answer TNW’s questions as to whether the same was true for YouTube, but the company’s spokesperson said in a discussion at the DisinfoLab conference that the company's studies showed people actually engaged more with quality content. Chaslot says this is something the big tech companies will have to debate between themselves, but based on his own experience, he’s more inclined to believe Zuckerberg at this point.

“We’ve got to realize that YouTube recommendations are toxic and it perverts civic discussion,” says Chaslot. “Right now the incentive is to create this type of borderline content that’s very engaging, but not forbidden.” Basically, the more outlandish content you make, the more likely it’ll keep people watching, which in turn will make it more likely to be recommended by the algorithm -- which results in greater revenue for the creator, and for YouTube.


But what about actual, concrete examples of problematic recommendations? 
When recommendations go wrong
In Chaslot’s mind, it should be enough to point out that the algorithm’s incentives are completely broken (i.e. watch time doesn’t equal quality) as an example of why it’s bad for us as a society. But to actually show its effects, he made the AlgoTransparency tool after he left Google. The tool is meant to give people a better overview of what’s actually being recommended on YouTube. 

Basically, it tries to find out which videos are shared by most channels to provide an overview you can’t get through your personal browsing. Chaslot points out that most often, the top recommended videos are innocuous, but every now and again, problematic videos pop up.


This video funded by the Russian government was recommended more than half a million times from more than 236 different channels.https://t.co/aRNUx2WIOm

— Guillaume Chaslot (@gchaslot) April 26, 2019


When the Mueller report detailing whether there was any collusion between Russia and Donald Trump's presidential campaign was released, Chaslot noticed that the analysis recommended from the most channels was a video from RT -- a state-sponsored Russian propaganda outlet. 

That means that if Chaslot is correct, YouTube’s algorithm amplified a video explaining the finding on possible Russian collusion made by… Russia. The video upholds what could be considered a Kremlin-friendly narrative and slams mainstream media. Naturally, Chaslot’s claim caught the attention of the media and was covered widely.

Chaslot says that while other Mueller-related videos got more total recommendations, the RT video stood out because it was recommended like crazy for two days and then nothing -- despite having relatively few views. 

“It was really strange to see this amount of channels that recommended this video, compared to how many views it had,” says Chaslot “The weird thing is that nobody really understands why this happened.”

Now it's important to get Google's side of things. Google has completely disowned AlgoTransparency's methodology (which you can find here) and told TNW it doesn't accurately reflect how recommendations work -- which are based on surveys, likes, dislikes, and shares.
As with most assertions made by AlgoTransparency, we have been unable to reproduce the results here. We’ve designed our systems to help ensure that content from more authoritative sources is surfaced prominently in search results and watch next recommendations in certain contexts, including when a viewer is watching news related content on YouTube.
Chaslot says that if there are discrepancies with his results, he'd love to know what they are. And the best way to do that, is for Google to simply share which videos YouTube is recommending to people. But the company hasn’t revealed more information on the matter.

Chaslot also points out that it seems his methods manage to highlight similar faults in the algorithm as Google does. Earlier this year, a Google software engineer gave a talk about correcting biases in YouTube and one of the videos used as an example of that had been flagged by AlgoTransparency before. So something about his approach seems to be working, but we won't know until Google becomes more transparent about recommendations.

What should we do about it?
YouTube doesn’t really provide any options now for users to control the recommendations they receive. Sure you can block some channels, but Chaslot points out that the algorithm might still push you towards similar channels as you’ve already “shown interest” in this type of content. So what can you do?

“The best short-term solution is to simply delete the recommendation function. I really don’t think it’s useful at all to the user,” Chaslot explains. “If YouTube wants to keep recommendations, it could stick to the curated ones done via email -- where humans make sure nothing crazy gets on there -- or just make them stick to channels you’ve subscribed to.”

Chaslot also acknowledges that most people -- himself included -- are too curious not to click borderline content, so he uses a Chrome extension called Nudge that removes addictive online features like Facebook’s News feed and YouTube recommendations. “I still click on stupid thing when I see them, so the best thing to is to just remove them.” 

[caption id=&quot;attachment_1212800&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;] Nudge removes all the addictive stuff from social media sites... which is pretty much everything.[/caption]

All of this is just to treat the symptoms, not the cause. Chaslot believes the real focus needs to be on long term solutions. At the moment, users are fighting against supercomputers to try to protect their free will, but it’s a losing battle with the current tools. 

That’s why Chaslot is convinced the only way forward is to provide proper transparency and give users real control: “In the long term, we need people to be in control of the AI, instead of AI controlling the users.”">

<h2><b>Recommendations are a waste of time</b></h2>
<p><span>You can see the recommendations in the “Up next” list on the 
right of the screen and they’ll also play automatically when you’ve got 
autoplay enabled. </span></p>
<p><span>These are the videos you should be wary of, according to 
Guillaume Chaslot. He’s the founder of&nbsp;a project to demand greater 
transparency from online platforms called <a href="https://algotransparency.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">AlgoTransparency</a>, and used to work at Google on YouTube’s recommendation algorithm. H</span><span>e says the motivations behind it are deeply flawed as it isn’t really about what the viewer wants.</span></p>

<p>“It isn’t inherently awful that YouTube uses AI to recommend video 
for you, because if the AI is well tuned it can help you get what you 
want. This would be amazing,” Chaslot told TNW. “But the problem is that
 the AI isn’t built to help you get what you want — it’s built to get 
you addicted to YouTube. Recommendations were designed to waste your 
time.”</p>
<p><span>Chaslot explains that the metric the algorithm uses to 
determine a ‘successful’ recommendations is watch time. This might be 
great for a company trying to sell ads, but doesn’t necessarily reflect 
what the user wants — and has grave side-effects. </span></p>
<h2><b>Engaging content gets recommended, which is bad</b></h2>
<p><span>During his talk at the </span><a href="https://www.disinfo.eu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span>DisinfoLab Conference</span></a><span>
 last month, Chaslot noted that divisive and sensational content is 
often recommended widely: conspiracy theories, fake news, flat-Earther 
videos, for example. Basically, the closer it stays the edge of what’s 
allowed under YouTube’s policy, the more engagement it gets. Google 
completely disagrees with Chaslot, but we’ll get to that later.</span></p>
<p><span>The basic structure of YouTube’s recommendation algorithm 
might’ve worked fine for its core types of content — like cat videos, 
gaming, and music. But as YouTube becomes more central in people’s 
information and news consumption, Chaslot worries recommendations will 
push people further to extremes — whether they want it or not — just 
because it’s in YouTube’s interest to keep us watching for as long as 
possible. </span></p>

<p><span>Mark Zuckerberg admitted last year that </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-blueprint-for-content-governance-and-enforcement/10156443129621634/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span>borderline content was more engaging</span></a>.
 Google did not want to answer TNW’s questions as to whether the same 
was true for YouTube, but the company’s spokesperson said in a 
discussion at the DisinfoLab conference that the company’s studies 
showed<span> people actually engaged more with quality content. Chaslot 
says this is something the big tech companies will have to debate 
between themselves, but based on his own experience, he’s more inclined 
to believe Zuckerberg at this point.</span></p>
<p><span>“We’ve got to realize that YouTube recommendations are toxic 
and it perverts civic discussion,” says Chaslot. “Right now the 
incentive is to create this type of borderline content that’s very 
engaging, but not forbidden.” Basically, the more outlandish content you
 make, the more likely it’ll keep people watching, which in turn will 
make it more likely to be recommended by the algorithm — which results 
in greater revenue for the creator, and for YouTube.<br></span></p>
<p><span>But what about actual, concrete examples of problematic recommendations? </span></p>
<h2><b>When recommendations go wrong</b></h2>
<p><span>In Chaslot’s mind, it should be enough to point out that the 
algorithm’s incentives are completely broken (i.e. watch time doesn’t 
equal quality) as an example of why it’s bad for us as a society. But to
 actually show its effects, he made the </span><a href="https://algotransparency.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span>AlgoTransparency</span></a><span> tool after he left Google. The tool is meant to give people a better overview of what’s actually being recommended on YouTube. </span></p>
<p><span>Basically, it tries to find out which videos are shared by most
 channels to provide an overview you can’t get through your personal 
browsing. Chaslot points out that most often, the top recommended videos
 are innocuous, but every now and again, problematic videos pop up.<br></span></p>

<p>— Guillaume Chaslot (@gchaslot) <a href="https://twitter.com/gchaslot/status/1121603846088736768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">April 26, 2019</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><script async="" src="widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span>When the Mueller report detailing whether there was any 
collusion between Russia and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign was 
released, Chaslot noticed that the analysis recommended from the most 
channels was a video from RT — a state-sponsored Russian propaganda 
outlet. </span></p>
<p><span>That means that if Chaslot is correct, YouTube’s algorithm 
amplified a video explaining the finding on possible Russian collusion 
made by… Russia. The video upholds what could be considered a 
Kremlin-friendly narrative and slams mainstream media. Naturally, 
Chaslot’s claim caught the attention of the media and was </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/04/26/youtube-recommended-russian-media-site-above-all-others-analysis-mueller-report-watchdog-group-says/?utm_term=.411db839498b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span>covered widely</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Chaslot says that while other Mueller-related videos got more 
total recommendations, the RT video stood out because it was recommended
 like crazy for two days and then nothing — despite having relatively 
few views. </span></p>
<p><span>“It was really strange to see this amount of channels that 
recommended this video, compared to how many views it had,” says Chaslot
 “The weird thing is that nobody really understands why this happened.”</span></p>
<p>Now it’s important to get Google’s side of things. Google has completely disowned AlgoTransparency’s methodology <span>(which you can find </span><a href="https://algotransparency.org/methodology.html?candidat=Benoit%20Hamon&amp;file=ytrecos-presidentielle-2017-06-10" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span>here</span></a><span>) and told TNW it doesn’t accurately reflect how recommendations work — which are based on surveys, likes, dislikes, and shares.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>As with most assertions made by AlgoTransparency, 
we have been unable to reproduce the results here. We’ve designed our 
systems to help ensure that content from more authoritative sources is 
surfaced prominently in search results and watch next recommendations in
 certain contexts, including when a viewer is watching news related 
content on YouTube.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Chaslot says that if there are discrepancies with his results, he’d 
love to know what they are. And the best way to do that, is for Google 
to simply share which videos YouTube is recommending to people. But the 
company hasn’t revealed more information on the matter.</p>
<p>Chaslot also points out that it seems his methods manage to highlight
 similar faults in the algorithm as Google does. Earlier this year, a 
Google software engineer gave a talk about correcting biases in YouTube 
and one of the videos used as an example of that had been flagged by 
AlgoTransparency before. So something about his approach seems to be 
working, but we won’t know until Google becomes more transparent about 
recommendations.</p>

<h2><b>What should we do about it?</b></h2>
<p><span>YouTube doesn’t really provide any options now for users to 
control the recommendations they receive. Sure you can block some 
channels, but Chaslot points out that the algorithm might still push you
 towards similar channels as you’ve already “shown interest” in this 
type of content. So what can you do?</span></p>
<p><span>“The best short-term solution is to simply delete the 
recommendation function. I really don’t think it’s useful at all to the 
user,” Chaslot explains. “If YouTube wants to keep recommendations, it 
could stick to the curated ones done via email — where humans make sure 
nothing crazy gets on there — or just make them stick to channels you’ve
 subscribed to.”</span></p>
<p><span>Chaslot also acknowledges that most people — himself included —
 are too curious not to click borderline content, so he uses a Chrome 
extension called </span><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nudge/dmhgdnbkjkejeddddlklojinngaideac" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span>Nudge</span></a><span>
 that removes addictive online features like Facebook’s News feed and 
YouTube recommendations. “I still click on stupid thing when I see them,
 so the best thing to is to just remove them.” </span></p>

<p><span>All of this is just to treat the symptoms, not the cause. 
Chaslot believes the real focus needs to be on long term solutions. At 
the moment, users are fighting against supercomputers to try to protect 
their free will, but it’s a losing battle with the current tools. </span></p>
<p><span>That’s why Chaslot is convinced the only way forward is to 
provide proper transparency and give users real control: “In the long 
term, we need people to be in control of the AI, instead of AI 
controlling the users.”</span></p>
