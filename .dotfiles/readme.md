# README for my Dotfiles

## Installing Arch

The Arch installer folder will hold all my files during the installer phase, that will help install things like my desktop environment, and window environment and such.

Im not the best at installations, so my thought process is, ill set it up once, and take notes on what im doing, and that way the next time I reinstall, I can use the arch-installer folder to set it all up, so that I know i havent missed something.

There will be a guide for myself inside that folder, in case anyone else wants to use it.
